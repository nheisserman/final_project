final project for 1051: Jelli-Belly
My final project is a version of Snake. To make my project unique I decided to create my own graphics for the game. My game is a jellyfish that moves around the screen collecting algae. This project relied a lot on the use of vectors, so I learned a lot about that while working on it. I was planning on adding walls to the game but I couldn't figure out the best way to do that and didn't end up with enough time to figure it out because the graphics actually took a lot longer than I thought. For a while, I struggled with getting my images to fit correctly into my screen and to get them to move the way I wanted. Getting the jellyfish head to point in the correct direction was actually a simple fix and turned out to just be a typo in my code, however it took me a while to realize what was going wrong. To fit my graphics into the screen, I used graphics included with the tutorial I used and figured out how big they were, then resized mine to match. I really enjoyed working on this project, especially because once I got far enough into the code, every time I ran my code I got to play the game for a bit (which was actually kind of distracting at times). Overall I am really proud of my project and happy with how everything turned out.
