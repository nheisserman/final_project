# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Still brainstorming. 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A version of the snake game. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will be making a snake game using pygame. The goal of the game is to move the snake around without bumping into the walls of the window. As the snake moves around, you are trying to eat food that will increase the snake in size and increase your points. The longer the snake gets, the more difficult it gets to maneuver around the window without hitting the walls or running into your own tail. I will initially use a tutorial on how to code the game and then will add in some of my own features. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I can definitely achieve creating a moving snake and the boundaries of the map. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think that I can accomplish fully coding the game. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I'm still working out exaclty how to make the game unique but I am hoping to fully code the game while also adding in some of my own features, and I am pretty confident that I can accomplish this before the deadline.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps are to learn more about pygame and how that works. There are a few tutorials on how to code this game so I want to pick my favorite and start working from there. At the same time, I will try to work on how to make the graphics of the game my own and brainstorming some unique features that I can add to the game.
