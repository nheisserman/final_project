Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

My project is coding a version of the snake game. So far, I have coded the fruit that appears in random spots of the screen after the snake "eats" it. I have a moving snake that grows when it eats the fruit and have coded "game-enders" like the snake running into the borders of the screen or into its own tail. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I still have to create my own graphics for the game and code them in. My plan to alter th graphics of the game is to make the snake a jellyfish and the apples algea. The background will be underwater. I also have to add in a score-tracker. I am planning on adding in walls or something along those lines to make the game a bit more challenging. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Everything has gone pretty smoothly so far.
